    "All ducks have highly waterproof feathers. A duck's feathers are so waterproof that even when the duck dives underwater, the downy underlayer of feathers right next to the skin will stay completely dry.",
    "Ducks are omnivorous and will eat grass, aquatic plants, insects, seeds, fruit, fish, crustaceans and other types of food.",
    "Ducklings younger than 10 days tend to swim and walk as a group, always close to their mother, to avoid the attack of predators.",
    "Most duck species are monogamous for a breeding season but they do not often mate for life. Instead, they will seek out new mates each year, choosing the healthiest, strongest, best mate who can help them pass on their genes to a new duckling generation.",
    "Ducks are outgoing, social animals who feel most at ease when they're in a larger group of other ducks.",
    "Ducks are birds. Ducks are also called ‘waterfowl’ because they are normally found in places where there is water like ponds, streams, and rivers.",
    "Ducks can live up to 20 years, depending on the species and if well cared for.",
    "The production of eggs is affected by daylight. When there is more daylight, the ducks will lay more eggs. To prevent this from happening, farmers use artificial lighting so that the ducks have about 17 hours of light a day to produce eggs efficiently.",
    "The eggs will hatch within 28 days normally, except for the Muscovy duck which takes about 35 days to hatch. The mother duck will keep her brood of ducklings together to protect them from predators.",
    "Ducks have been domesticated as pets and farm animals for more than 500 years, and all domestic ducks are descended from either the mallard or the Muscovy duck. Mallards, especially, are easy to crossbreed with other types of ducks, and mallards often hybridize with all types of ducks at local ponds.",
    "All types of ducks are part of the bird family Anatidae, which also includes swans and geese. There are between 140 and 175 birds in the Anatidae family, though not all of them are considered ducks.",
    "There are species of ducks found on every continent except Antarctica. Some duck species, such as the mallard, are found in multiple places throughout the world, while others have very small, restricted ranges.",
    "A baby duck is called a duckling, and an adult male duck is referred to as a drake. An adult female duck is called a hen or a duck, and a group of ducks can be called a raft, a team, or a paddling. Generic terms like bird, chick, and flock also apply to ducks.",
    "All ducks have highly waterproof feathers as a result of an intricate feather structure and a waxy coating that's spread on each feather while preening. A duck's feathers are so waterproof that, even when the duck dives underwater, its downy underlayer of feathers right next to the skin will stay completely dry. The uropygial gland at the base of the tail produces the waxy oil that coats feathers so well—many other birds also have the same gland.",
    "Ducks are precocial, which means that their ducklings are covered with down and able to walk and leave the nest just a few hours after hatching. This independence actually helps to protect the young chicks from predators, since they don't need to stay in the vulnerable nest area for long.",
    "A hen will lead her ducklings by foot up to half a mile or more to find a suitable water source for swimming and feeding. As soon as a baby duck's down is dry after hatching, they will be able to swim. It isn't unusual to see very tiny ducklings swimming after their mother.",
    "Male ducks have an eclipse plumage similar to females that they wear after the breeding season for about a month as their new feathers grow. During that month, they are completely flightless and therefore more vulnerable to predators. Because of this, many male ducks stay in isolated, remote areas or flock together for protection in numbers during this time.",
    "Most duck species are monogamous for a breeding season, but they don't typically mate for life. Instead, they will seek out new mates each year, choosing the healthiest, strongest, best mate who can help them pass on their genes to a new duckling generation.",
    "While constructing their nests, female ducks will line it with soft down feathers they pluck from their own breast. This gives their eggs the best possible cushioning and insulation and exposes the hen's skin so she can keep the eggs warm more efficiently. Other duck nesting materials include grass, mud, twigs, leaves, reeds, and other plant material.",
    "Ducks are omnivorous, opportunistic eaters and will eat grass, aquatic plants, insects, seeds, fruit, fish, nuts, crustaceans, and other types of food. Some ducks, such as mergansers, are more specialized in their dietary needs, but most types of ducks can adapt well to a variety of food sources. This helps ensure they always have adequate nutrition and can often stay in the same range year-round as different foods become available.",
    "A duck's bill is shaped to help it forage in mud and strain food from the water. A hard nail at the tip of the bill helps with foraging, while the lamellae—a comb-like structure on the sides of the bill—strains small insects and crustaceans from the water.",
    "Most male ducks are silent, and very few ducks actually \"quack.\" Instead, their calls may include squeaks, grunts, groans, chirps, whistles, brays, and growls. Females can also make a wide range of different noises and are usually more vocal than their male counterparts.",
    "It is a myth that a duck's quack won't echo. This has been conclusively disproved through scientific acoustic tests and was even featured as \"busted\" on an episode of the Discovery Channel show Mythbusters.",
    "Ducks have been domesticated as pets and farm animals for more than 500 years, and all domestic ducks are descended from either the mallard duck or the muscovy duck. Mallards are easy to crossbreed with other types of ducks and often hybridize with all types of ducks at local ponds. This can lead to very unusual feather shapes and color patterns that can make their offspring confusing to identify.",
    "There are more than 40 different breeds of domestic duck. The all-white Pekin duck (also called the Long Island duck) is the most common variety raised for eggs and meat, especially on large commercial farms. Smaller organizations or individual farmers often try out different duck breeds, depending on their needs and taste preferences.",
    "Because of their familiarity, ducks are often featured as fictional characters. The two most famous fictional ducks are Disney's Donald Duck, which premiered in 1934, and Warner Bros.' Daffy Duck, which premiered in 1937. Ducks have also been icons for companies and featured in advertising campaigns, and some ducks are even mascots for schools, businesses, and sports teams."
